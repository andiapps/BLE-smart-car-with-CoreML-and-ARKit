# BLE-smart-car-with-CoreML-and-ARKit *Phase 1
Idea: Smart Arduino car controlled by trained CoreML modles by using ARKit's camera feature. There will be 3D object detection feature adding in very soon. The ultimate goal is to create a new way for virtual obejct interacting with real world object (The smart car in this case). For Phase 1 there is a ARKit 2.0 image tracking feature being tested, if the objecting detecting speed isn't satisfactory 3D object detecting will be tested in Phase 2
